This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Challenge
- create a simple React calendar app
- Must use React
- Code must be source controlled in a public git repo
- You can use any other open source tools to help you

## App specs
- Display all dates for at least current month
- Appointments cannot be created in the past
- Appointments should appear on the calendar
- No two appointments should overlap
- If an appointment exists for a day, a warning should display
- Appointments can be edited and deleted

## Tentative plan
- find the start of the current month (date and day of the week) using moment.js. use this to fill in the days of the month
- any days before today are greyed out and can't be interacted with
- each day has the number of the day; the area below that is the appointment
- include start/end times for dates

- first: get the calendar displaying for the month
- second: add the functionality to select a date and add an appointment
- third: add the ability to check if an appointment exists already




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
